## Data Understanding
Data from 1962 to 2022 was presented on aircraft accidents that occured in the United States and other countries in the world.
From the data, 93 % of it was aircraft accidents in the United States.
There were 30 variables. The variables that had 30% or more of missing variables were dropped to make the analysis more informative.
Rows that had missing values in the fatal, minor,serious injuries were dropped as well as missing values in the uninjured column.
Columns that did not necessarily give helpful information such as the registration number were dropped.
A state column was extracted from the location column to identify which state had the most accidents.
The event year was extracted from the event date to be able to show the trend on accidents over the years using a line graph.
Since the missing values had reduced. The categorical columns were imputed with "unknown" and the numerical columns with "0".

## Data Visualization

  ## Recommendations
  Purchase an aircraft with more than one engine, to reduce the risk of accidents.
  Purchase a Boeng aircraft as it had among the least accidents for both commercial and business purposes
  The Turbo fan engine should be considered as it has the most uninjured people and among the least involvement in the accidents.
